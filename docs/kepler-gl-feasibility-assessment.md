# Kepler.gl Feasibility Assessment for Site Planning Workflows

## Executive Summary

**RECOMMENDATION: Kepler.gl is NOT SUITABLE for site planning workflows**

Kepler.gl is fundamentally designed as a **data visualization and analysis tool** for large-scale geospatial datasets, not as an **interactive drawing and editing platform** for site planning. The core architectural mismatch makes it unsuitable for the required site planning workflows.

**Note**: A potential Kepler.gl MCP (Model Context Protocol) integration was mentioned but documentation was not accessible during this assessment. This should be investigated further if considering Kepler.gl.

## Detailed Gap Analysis

### 1. Drawing Tool Capabilities

**‚ùå CRITICAL LIMITATION: No Interactive Drawing Tools**

Kepler.gl's polygon layers are designed for **displaying** pre-existing geometry data loaded from files (GeoJSON, GeoArrow), not for creating polygons interactively.

**Missing Capabilities:**

- No built-in drawing tools for creating polygons
- No vertex-level editing capabilities
- No real-time shape manipulation features
- No freehand drawing support

**Impact**: Site planning workflows are fundamentally impossible without interactive drawing tools.

### 2. Building Placement & 3D Object Management

**‚ùå MAJOR GAP: Limited 3D Object Management**

Kepler.gl supports 3D visualization but not interactive 3D object placement or manipulation.

**Missing Capabilities:**

- No drag-and-drop building placement
- No real-time 3D editing of objects
- No constraint systems for zoning compliance
- No interactive object manipulation

**Impact**: Core site planning workflow of placing and positioning buildings is not supported.

### 3. Professional Precision & Accuracy

**‚ö†Ô∏è PARTIAL SUPPORT: Visualization Precision Only**

Kepler.gl supports professional coordinate systems for display but lacks precision tools for interactive work.

**Missing Capabilities:**

- No measurement tools for interactive calculations
- No precision drawing tools for site planning scales
- Limited surveying integration capabilities

**Impact**: Professional accuracy requirements cannot be met for site planning work.

### 4. Integration Complexity Analysis

**üîß HIGH COMPLEXITY: Fundamental Architecture Mismatch**

**Current Architecture:**

- Google Maps-based interactive drawing system
- Real-time geometry manipulation
- Integrated measurement and validation systems

**Kepler.gl Architecture:**

- Data visualization focused
- File-based geometry loading
- Limited interactivity

**Integration Challenges:**

1. **Complete UI Rebuild**: Would require rebuilding all drawing interfaces
2. **Custom Tool Development**: All interactive tools would need custom development
3. **Data Pipeline Redesign**: Current real-time workflows incompatible
4. **Performance Concerns**: Not optimized for frequent geometry updates

## Alternative Recommendations

Since Kepler.gl is unsuitable for site planning workflows, consider these alternatives:

### 1. **Continue with Current Google Maps + Custom Tools Stack**

- **Pros**: Proven, feature-complete, optimized for site planning
- **Cons**: Requires continued custom development
- **Recommendation**: Enhance current system rather than replace

### 2. **Mapbox GL JS with Drawing Plugins**

- **Pros**: More customizable than Google Maps, better performance
- **Cons**: Requires significant migration effort
- **Use Case**: If seeking more advanced visualization capabilities

### 3. **Leaflet with Drawing Plugins**

- **Pros**: Lightweight, highly customizable, extensive plugin ecosystem
- **Cons**: More development overhead
- **Use Case**: If seeking maximum customization flexibility

### 4. **Hybrid Approach: Kepler.gl for Analysis + Current Stack for Drawing**

- **Pros**: Leverage Kepler.gl's visualization strengths for data analysis
- **Cons**: Complex dual-system architecture
- **Use Case**: If advanced geospatial analysis is needed alongside site planning

## Risk Assessment

### Technical Risks of Adopting Kepler.gl

1. **Feature Regression Risk: HIGH**

   - Loss of all interactive drawing capabilities
   - Loss of real-time measurement tools
   - Loss of building placement workflows

2. **Development Effort Risk: VERY HIGH**

   - Complete rewrite of core functionality required
   - Custom tool development for all interactive features
   - Uncertain timeline and complexity

3. **User Experience Risk: HIGH**

   - Fundamental workflow disruption
   - Loss of professional site planning capabilities
   - Potential user adoption resistance

4. **Performance Risk: MEDIUM**
   - Unknown performance with frequent geometry updates
   - Not optimized for interactive editing workflows

## Final Recommendation

**DO NOT ADOPT Kepler.gl for site planning workflows.**

### Key Decision Factors:

1. **Fundamental Architecture Mismatch**: Kepler.gl is designed for data visualization, not interactive drawing
2. **Critical Feature Gaps**: Missing all essential site planning tools (drawing, editing, measurements)
3. **High Implementation Risk**: Would require complete system rewrite with uncertain outcomes
4. **Better Alternatives Available**: Current Google Maps stack is more suitable and proven

### Recommended Actions:

1. **Continue enhancing current Google Maps-based system**
2. **Investigate Kepler.gl MCP integration** if it becomes available and documented
3. **Consider Kepler.gl for future data analysis features** (separate from core site planning)
4. **Evaluate Mapbox GL JS** if advanced visualization capabilities are needed

### If Kepler.gl Must Be Considered:

1. **Investigate MCP Integration**: The mentioned Kepler.gl MCP could potentially address some limitations
2. **Prototype Core Workflows**: Build proof-of-concept for critical drawing operations
3. **Assess Custom Development Effort**: Estimate effort to build missing interactive tools
4. **User Testing**: Validate that any Kepler.gl-based solution meets user needs

## Conclusion

Kepler.gl's strengths in large-scale geospatial data visualization do not align with the interactive, precision-focused requirements of site planning workflows. The current Google Maps-based architecture is significantly more suitable for the application's needs.

The fundamental mismatch between Kepler.gl's data visualization focus and the application's interactive drawing requirements makes adoption inadvisable without substantial evidence that the MCP integration or other developments have addressed these core limitations.
